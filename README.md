This is my second Excel assignment for data analytics. The workbook demonstrates the differences between Relative, Absolute, and Mixed Referencing in Excel formulas. It includes two practical examples illustrating how each referencing method works."

Key Improvements:
Conciseness – Removed redundant phrases (e.g., "This Excel workbook" → "The workbook").

Clarity – Simplified the description of referencing types (e.g., "Relative Referencing" → "Relative").

Flow – Combined related ideas for smoother readability.
